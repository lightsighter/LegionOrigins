\section{Introduction}
\label{sect:intro}
Modern parallel machines are increasingly complex, with deep,
distributed memory hierarchies and heterogeneous processing units.  On
these architectures, it is crucial for performance that the programmer
and the compiler be able to reason about {\em locality} (data residing
close to computation that uses it) and {\em independence} (two
computations on disjoint data are independent).  Most contemporary
languages have no facilities for the programmer to express locality
and independence, and the existing research proposals are particularly
limited in expressing these properties for pointer data structures.

In this paper we describe Legion, a parallel programming system based
on using {\em logical regions} to describe the organization of data.
A logical region names a set of objects.  Logical regions are first
class values in Legion, and in particular may be passed as arguments
to functions that access the data in those regions, providing locality
information.  Logical regions may be {\em partitioned} into (usually)
disjoint subregions, providing information for determining independence of computations.  Furthermore,
computations access logical regions with a particular {\em coherence}
(e.g., {\em exclusive access}and {\em atomic access}, among others)
and only if they have the correct {\em permissions} (e.g., {\em
  read-only} and {\em read-write}, among others).

We begin with an extended example of a Legion program in Section~\ref{sec:ex}.
Subsequent sections each highlight a contribution of our work:
 
\begin{itemize}

\item We describe the execution semantics for Legion and show that 
analyzing region dependencies with a single function is sufficient to 
guarantee that a Legion execution preserves sequential program
behavior if regions are accessed with the strongest (exclusive)
coherence (Section~\ref{sec:exec}).  This local scheduling property is central to 
scalable and distributed Legion implementation.

\item We summarize Legion's static type system (Section~\ref{sec:type}), which serves two primary
  purposes.  First, pointers to regions are checked
  statically, eliminating the need for expensive runtime checks.
  Second, the invariant that a function $f$ accesses only
  regions passed as arguments to $f$, or subregions of those regions, is enforced.
  This property guarantees the Legion implementation can rely on
  preservation of independence---if two functions are passed disjoint
  region arguments, their computations access disjoint
data.  

\item We describe the design and implementation of the Legion {\em high-level runtime}
system (Section~\ref{sec:highlevel}), which performs scheduling of {\em tasks} (functions to be executed in parallel)
and implements each logical region as one or more {\em physical regions}.
The high-level runtime's scheduling is analogous to the capabilities of an out-of-order processor,
but works at the granularity of the tasks and regions in a function body rather than instructions and registers
in a code block.  We describe the stages of the task execution pipeline, and how the high-level runtime coordinates parallel
scheduling decisions across the machine.  We also present the {\em mapping} interface, an API by which
application-specific knowledge can be incorporated into decisions made by the high-level runtime.

\item We describe the design and implementation of the Legion {\em low-level runtime} (Section~\ref{sec:lowlevel} ,
a portability layer designed to abstract a wide variety of hardware, including multicor chips, clusters, and accelerators
such as GPUs. 

\item We present the results of experiments on three applications running on a cluster of multicore processors with
attached GPUs (Section~\ref{sec:exp}).  The applications are all highly irregular and dynamic and illustrate the capability of Legion to 
exploit locality and independence on such platforms.
