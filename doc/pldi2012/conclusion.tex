\section{Conclusion}
We have presented Legion, a programming model and
type system for expressing locality and independence
to target heterogenous, distributed parallel architectures.  
We implemented both a portable high-level and machine 
abstraction low-level runtime to support the Legion 
programming model.  Our implementation of Legion demonstrated
speedups up to 5.9X on a cluster of GPUs.
